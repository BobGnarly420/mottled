/* reading.js — what this scene is, how much of it survived the projection,
 * and what produced it.
 *
 * The explorer has always said this next to its figure: projection fidelity
 * inline, ✕ markers on low-fidelity states, the validity contract under the
 * scene. The viewer said none of it — and the viewer is the surface a scene
 * gets *shared* on, where the reader has no session, no config and no author
 * to ask. An attractive picture with nothing attached is exactly the
 * research-validity risk docs/validity.md exists to name.
 *
 * Everything here is derived from what the scene file already carries: per-run
 * neighborhood preservation, the density standard-error field, and the
 * analysis record (provenance.py) that `.mtj` has carried since the manifest
 * work. Nothing is recomputed and nothing is assumed — a scene that lacks a
 * layer says so rather than showing a blank.
 *
 * `fidelitySummary` is a port of `projection.fidelity_summary`, pinned by
 * tests/test_reading_conformance.py: the two surfaces must not report
 * different fidelity for the same run.
 *
 * UMD: `window.Reading` in the browser, `module.exports` under Node. */
