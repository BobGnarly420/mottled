"""The analysis record: what a scene was made with, machine-readable.

`docs/validity.md` asks anyone publishing on Mottled output to version-lock
model weights, tokenizer, library versions, precision, seeds and SAE artifact
hashes. That was a norm without an affordance — the knobs lived in a
`MarbleConfig` the user had to transcribe by hand, and the environment facts
lived nowhere at all, so a shared `.mtj` could not say what produced it.

`record()` collects the lot in one call and `statefile` carries the result in
the `.mtj` manifest under the additive key `"analysis"`, so a scene arrives
with its own methods section:

    rec = provenance.record(cfg, prompts=prompts, trajs=[traj])
    json.dumps(rec)                       # citable, timestamped, diffable

What this is not: evidence that the run reproduces. It is the
parameterization a reproduction *attempt* needs — the same distinction
`sae.fit_report` draws between provenance and calibration.
