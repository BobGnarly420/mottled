# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-14

First versioned release. Everything below landed since the MVP.

### Core
- `StateTrajectory` established as the project's interchange format:
  producers (transformers capture, Mamba, synthetic) emit one; analyses and
  viewers consume one.
- `.mtj` binary format v1 (`statefile.py`, spec in `docs/mtj-format.md`):
  full-fidelity trajectory files and compact viewer-ready scene bundles,
  with explicit forward-compatibility rules tested from Python and JS.
- Residual-stream capture with logit lens, resumable forward pass with
  causal interventions (perturb / set / noise / freeze), head-averaged
  attention capture, and exact attn/MLP residual decomposition (pinned
  against HF reference outputs on locally-built Llama and GPT-2).
- Mamba (state-space) producer via structural layout resolution — the
  abstraction is not transformer-shaped.

### Analysis
- Trajectory comparison: symmetric Hausdorff, dynamic time warping,
  shared-prefix alignment, layerwise divergence profiles.
- SAE features (applied, never trained): npz interchange, demo dictionary,
  per-state activations and top-features.
- Research metrics: path length, curvature, semantic drift, entropy
  collapse, neighbor stability, component shares.

### Viewers
- Streamlit explorer: A/B and N-prompt scenes on one shared terrain,
  animated marbles with a layer scrubber, token inspector (predictions,
  neighbors, SAE features, residual decomposition, attention), interactive
  patching panel, scene export.
- Dependency-free WebGL web viewer for `.mtj` scenes: terrain, densified
  trajectories, marbles, orbit camera, hover inspector, attention flow,
  run toggles, comparison table, drag-and-drop loading, and a capture form
  that appears when the backend is present.
- Everything styled to one design language (Incision): dark navy void,
  precision-blue accent, semantic data palette, mono-for-data typography.

### Distribution
- Pip-installable package (`pip install mottled`) with a `mottled` CLI:
  explorer (default), `serve` (viewer + capture API), `export` (prompts →
  `.mtj`).
- `serve.py`: standard-library capture backend the viewer discovers at
  runtime, so the browser can generate trajectories directly.
- GitHub Pages deployment: landing page + viewer + sample scenes
  (synthetic and real GPT-2 captures).
- CI: pytest (offline, including torch mechanism tests on locally-built
  models) + Node tests for the viewer's `.mtj` parser.
