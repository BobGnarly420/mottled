"""Why the attractor forms, and what it is made of.

The terrain the marbles settle into is not an external landscape — it is a
kernel-density field over the run's own projected states.  A "basin" is
therefore a *pile-up*: many (layer, token) states landing in the same
neighborhood.  This module measures the mechanism behind that pile-up so
the UI can explain it instead of merely drawing it:

- **deceleration** — the per-layer residual-stream step of a tracked token
  peaks early and shrinks late; once steps are small, consecutive layers
  deposit near-identical states and density rises there;
- **constitution** — which (layer, token) states actually sit above a
  density threshold (the basin's membership roster);
- **meaning** — whether the logit-lens readout has stabilized and entropy
  has collapsed inside the basin, and (when components were captured)
  whether the settled writes come from attention or the MLP.

`analyze` produces the numbers; `explain` turns one report into prose.
"Attractor" here is descriptive geometry — where this run's states
accumulate — not a dynamical-systems claim.  Everything is a pure numpy
function over (StateTrajectory, coords, Landscape); no transformer
internals, any backend.
